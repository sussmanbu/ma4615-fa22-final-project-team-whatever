## The State of the World's Children Under the Age of 5: what countries are better equipped for a stronger, healther generation? 
>>>>>>> e81408f447c397726fb09da6577f1271ad561f05



After our analysis with the institutional data, we have outlined a few notable factors that potentially influence the world's child mortality rates. With this information, we can provide possible suggestions about what can be done to uphold the standards of the countries with the lowest mortality rates for children under the age of 5. 


As you scroll through this page, you will see us comparing the top three countries with the lowest and highest mortality rates, and what factors differ between them. 


In the end, we hope that you are able to have more of an insight into the main differences between the state of children in countries across the world, over a span of time. This will also provide some awareness for future patterns as well.

Here we will show the relationships between the factors for the top three countries with both the lowest and highest mortality rates. 

*Note: Figures must be simple enough for the general audience to understand.

### Explanation of Figures: 




## The Big Conclusion: 

Overall, our project was inspired by the work that the UNICEF organization does in collecting data to better understand what needs to be done to better improve the lives of children across the world. With the analysis we have provided on this page, we have described a few of the many factors that are affecting the survival of children. 

### The most influential factors that contribute to whether a country would have a low or high mortality rate for children under 5 are shown below:
