## The State of the World's Children Under the Age of 5: what countries are better equipped for a stronger, healther generation? 

After all of our analysis with these data sets, we have discovered a few notable findings about the influencers of the world's child mortality rates. With this information, we can provide possible suggestions about what needs to be done to uphold the standards that countries with the lowest mortality rates. 


As you scroll through this page, you will see us comparing the top three countries with the lowest and highest mortality rates, and what factors differ between them. 

In the end, we hope that you are able to have more of an insight into the main differences between the state of children under the age of 5 in countries across the world.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!

```{r}
#need to set up working directory perhaps? --> setwd()
load(here::here("dataset/income_mortality.RData"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
#run this chunck if not previously installed: install.packages("gapminder")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))

data(income_mortality.RData, package = "gapminder")
gg <- ggplot(income_mortality,
  aes(x = Income, y = Mortality)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_point(aes(frame = Year)) +
  scale_x_log10()
ggplotly(gg)


#color = continent, size = pop
```



### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.
