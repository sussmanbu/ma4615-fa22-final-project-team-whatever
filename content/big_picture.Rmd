#add title 

#thesis/goal - what are we trying to show - for general public 

#figure for big picture and explanations


#creative - what is our story 

#no code should be visible on this page. we must use `echo=FALSE`


#include interactive: good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.


This comes from the file `content/big_picture.Rmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!

```{r}
#need to set up working directory perhaps? --> setwd()
load(here::here("dataset/income_mortality.RData"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
#run this chunck if not previously installed: install.packages("gapminder")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))

data(income_mortality.RData, package = "gapminder")
gg <- ggplot(income_mortality,
  aes(x = Income, y = Mortality)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_point(aes(frame = Year)) +
  scale_x_log10()
ggplotly(gg)

#color = continent, size = pop
```



### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
