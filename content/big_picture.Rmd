## The State of the World's Children Under the Age of 5: what countries are better equipped for a stronger, healther generation? 



After our analysis with the institutional data, we have outlined a few notable factors that potentially influence the world's child mortality rates. With this information, we can provide possible suggestions about what can be done to uphold the standards of the countries with the lowest mortality rates for children under the age of 5. 


As you scroll through this page, you will see us comparing the top three countries with the lowest and highest mortality rates, and what factors differ between them. 


In the end, we hope that you are able to have more of an insight into the main differences between the state of children in countries across the world, over a span of time. This will also provide some awareness for future patterns as well.
