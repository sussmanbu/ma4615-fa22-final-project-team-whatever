We describe here our detailed data analysis.


```{r}

## Motivation for Our Data Analysis

Our data is mainly driven by investigating

## Modeling and Inference

## Clarity Figures

  
  
*explain your plots here  

```{r}
# Interesting structure for visualizing mortality rates by world regions when we'll have the world regions variable in the income_mortality data set

 #ggplot(nd_regions, aes(x=Country, y=LowBirthWT, color=Country)) +
     #geom_point(position="jitter") +
     #coord_polar("x") +
     #labs(title="% of Low Birth Weights by World Region", x="", y="", color ="Country" )
```



```{r}
#need to place region names in the x axis vertically
 nd_regions%>%ggplot() +
   geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(Country, -LowBirthWT), y = LowBirthWT, fill = Country), stat = 'identity') +
   labs(title = '% of Low Birth Weights by World Region', x = 'World Region', y = '% of Low Birth Weights')
