We describe here our detailed data analysis. Most of our data for analysis is accredited to UNICEF database.   

On this page we will introduce you to our analysis, provide some initial questions about the data, and present the figures we produced while exploring the different relationships within the data.

## Our Motivation for Analysis

Our data is mainly driven by investigating the state of the world’s children under the age of 5. Through our analysis, we will have a better idea of how influential our chosen variables are to the survival and health of children around the world. 



Some variables we are most interested in include:
   
   
    * Nutrition
    * Low birth weight 
    * Minimum diet diversity(6-23months)
    * Minimum meal frequency(6-23months)
    * Zero vegetable or fruit consumption (6-23months)
    + Mortality Rate 
	        * Includes years 1950 - 2020
    + Income per capita



With these variables, we hope to learn more about the connection between economics, nutrition, and child mortality across regions. We can also try to get some idea as to what triggers a higher child mortality rate in particular nations with respect to the variables above. Then, we could compare the differences with countries with a lower rate. As a result, it might be possible to pinpoint improvements that could be made to the children's living circumstances as well as the areas where making changes would have the greatest potential to save young lives. 

## [Summary of Variables](/analysis3)

## Initial Questions 

1. What are the differences in low birthweight between each world region?
2. What is the relationship over time between mortality rates for children under the age of 5?
3. Does income have a significant contribution to the characteristics of a country with lower mortality rates?
4. What are some relationships between nutrition variables, such as exclusive breast feeding rate and the average income per capita per region?
5. As the income increases, does diet diversity also increase for the children's nutrition?


## [Flaws and Limitations of Analysis](/analysis2)

Please click on the link above to direct you to the discussion about the limitations we ran into while working with the data. 


## Figure one: Low Birthweight in each Region

Here, we wanted to give a visual to represent the percentage variability in low birthweight among these regions. Based on the bar chart, South Asia has a visible larger percentage of children that fall in this category. Moving forward, we will keep an eye on South Asia and the relationships that may have impacted this one. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(nd_regions, aes(Country , LowBirthWT,  fill=Country)) + 
    coord_flip() +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.90) + 
    xlab("Region") + 
    ylab("Low Birth Weight Percentage") + 
    guides(fill=FALSE) +
    ggtitle("Percentage of Children Underweight in World Regions") + 
    theme_minimal()
```


## Figure Two: Mortality Rates and Income per Capita 

This figure shows that over time, mortality rates have decreased. We have grouped the countries into their respective continent, so the relationships between the continents can be viewed easily through the time span here. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset/income_mortality.RData"))

#maybe need to include different regions and color them with "color = " under ggplot aes (instead of Income)

income_mortality %>% filter(Year == "1950" | Year == "1975" | Year == "2000" | Year == "2020") %>% ggplot(aes(x = Income, y = Mortality, color = Continent)) + geom_point(size = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~as.factor(Year)) +
  stat_smooth(aes(group = Year), color='black', alpha = 0.4, geom = "line") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Income Per Capita (PPP)", y = "Under 5 Mortality Rate", title = "Disparity across Under 5 Mortality Rates has decreased over time")
```


## Figure Three: Relationship between Income and Infant's that are exclusively breastfed

This is our first attempt at exploring a variable from the nutrition data set with income per capita. Here we are able to see that as income increases, exclusive breast feeding for children's nutrition decreases. Exclusive breast feeding, according to this data, is described as the

    > Percentage of infants 0-5 months of age who were fed exclusively with breastmilk during the previous day.

This relationship with income could signify that higher income regions are more likely to have alternatives to breastfeeding for infants. Of course this is just a hypothesis, but a question to keep in mind. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset/nd_inc_mort_avg.RData"))
ggplot(nd_inc_mort_avg, aes(x = Income_avg, y = ExclusiveBreastFeeding)) + geom_point(size = 0.4) +
  stat_smooth(color='black', alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Average Income Per Capita (PPP)", y = "Exclusive Breast Feeding Rate", title = "As income increases, exclusive breast feeding for children's nutrition decreases")
```


## Figure Four: Relationship between Income per capita and Child Diet Diversity 

Below is a figure that suggets that the diet diversity variable steadily increases as the average income per capita increases. 
Minimum diet diversity, according to the data, is defined as: 

    >Percentage of children who received foods from at least 5 out of 8 defined food groups during the previous day. 
    
With this in mind, a possible synthesis is that higher averages of income provide more opportunities to fulfill the diet for all 8 defined food groups. 



```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset/nd_inc_mort_avg.RData"))
ggplot(nd_inc_mort_avg, aes(x = Income_avg, y = DietDiversity)) + geom_point(size = 0.4) +
  stat_smooth(color='black', alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(x = "Average Income Per Capita (PPP)", y = "Diet Diversity", title = "As income increases, diet diversity for children's nutrition increases")
```


## Figure Five: World Map: Under 5 Mortality Rates across countries
Below, we use the world map to give a clear representation of the how mortality rates are distributed across the world. The darker colored blue countries show a much higher rate than those with the very light color. We are also able to see the change in color across each continent, or region, which is harder to see in other figures, which is way this is a good graphical representation of our main variable. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tidyverse)

world_map <- map_data("world")

#ggplot(world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
 # geom_polygon(fill="white", colour = "gray50") +
  #theme_classic()



world_map %>%
  left_join(income_mortality, by = c("region" = "Country")) -> act_world_map

act_world_map1970 <- act_world_map %>% filter(Year == c("1970"))

#ggplot(act_world_map1970,aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group))+
  #geom_polygon(aes(fill = Mortality),color = "white")+
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-180,210,45),labels = function(x){paste0(x,"°")})+
  #scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-60, 100, 30), labels = function(x){paste0(x, "°")})+
  #scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high="dark blue") +
  #theme_light()



act_world_map1990 <- act_world_map %>% filter(Year == c("1990"))



ggplot(act_world_map1990,aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = Mortality),color = "white")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-180,210,45),labels = function(x){paste0(x,"°")})+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-60, 100, 30), labels = function(x){paste0(x, "°")})+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high="dark blue") +
  theme_light()



act_world_map2000 <- act_world_map %>% filter(Year == c("2000"))



#ggplot(act_world_map2000,aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group))+
 # geom_polygon(aes(fill = Mortality),color = "white")+
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-180,210,45),labels = function(x){paste0(x,"°")})+
  #scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-60, 100, 30), labels = function(x){paste0(x, "°")})+
  #scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high="dark blue") +
  #theme_light()
```

## Figure Six
Here is a similair representation of the same data as above, however we are able to more clearly decipher the major trend in mortality rates across world region. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Interesting structure for visualizing mortality rates by world regions when we'll have the world regions variable in the income_mortality data set

load(here::here("dataset/income_mortality.RData"))


 ggplot(income_mortality, aes(x=Continent, y=Mortality, color=Continent)) +
     geom_point(position="jitter", size = 0.3) +
     coord_polar("x") +
     labs(title="Relative Under 5 Mortality Rates by World Region", x="", y="", color ="Country" )

```

## Figure Seven: correlation between under 5 mortality rates and income per capita

This figure explores the relationship between income and mortality. As forecasted, we see that as the income increases, the mortality rates show a pattern of decline, with a few outliers. 



```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data(income_mortality)
a <- cbind(income_mortality$'Mortality', income_mortality$'Income')
a2<-na.omit(a)
cor = cor(a2[,1],a2[,2])
#the correlation between the mortality and income 
print(cor)

ggplot(data = income_mortality, mapping = aes(x = income_mortality$'Income', y = income_mortality$'Mortality')) +
  scale_x_log10() +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = 'Red')) + labs(x = "Income Per Capita", y = "Mortality rate")

```

## Figures Eight and Nine: Vaccines and Mortality Rates

Both of these figures use are vaccine variables to display their relationship with mortality rates as well. The vaccine variable represent the rate that a 1 year old child has at least one vaccine for a particular disease (please refer back to the variable explanation page for more information). We see a steady decline in overall mortality rates as the vaccination rate increases. The second figure presents this relationship across the years of 1980 - 2019, with points colored by the continent. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset/inc_mort_vax.RData"))
ggplot(inc_mort_vax, aes(x = Vax_Rate, y = Mortality)) + geom_point(size = 0.4) +
  stat_smooth(color='black', alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Vax Rate for at least one disease, 1 y/o children", y = "Under 5 Mortality", title = "Vaccination Rates are negatively correlated with Under 5 Mortality Rates")

inc_mort_vax %>% filter(Year == "1980" | Year == "1990" | Year == "2000" | Year == "2019") %>% ggplot(aes(x = Vax_Rate, y = Mortality, color = Continent)) + geom_point(size = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~as.factor(Year)) +
  stat_smooth(aes(group = Year), color='black', alpha = 0.4, geom = "line") +
  labs(x = "Vax Rate for at least one disease, 1 y/o children", y = "Under 5 Mortality Rate", title = "Vaccination Rates have increased over time, while Under 5 Mortality Rates fell")
```
