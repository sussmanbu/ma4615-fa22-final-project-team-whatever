<p>~“The State of the World’s Children”: Nutrition Tables (2019) <em>since I cannot find a direct link, please use this link: <a href="https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/sowc-2019-statistical-tables/" class="uri">https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/sowc-2019-statistical-tables/</a>
and scroll down to “Tables 7 and 8- Nutrition” to view the tables.</em></p>
<p>This data comes from UNICEF, the United Nations International Children’s Fund, which is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children across the world who suffer from poverty, violence, and lack of education. Their website includes a strong database that reveal how the state of children in every region of the world. They believe that equity, the core of their mission, is not possible without gathering this data. According to their website, they are the leaders in data collection in this topic of interest.</p>
<p>This particular data set is the Nutrition report for preschool/school age children and women that ranges from 2013-2016. Its sources include national household surveys, and modeled estimates from UNICEF. One table has approximately 200 rows and 18 columns, but we believe that we could find a way to combine the two to increase that number. There is much opportunity to clean the data, as there are some missing values, values that belong to different years, and a few other notes listed for us at the bottom of the table. The main question we would like to ask would be what the most acceptable condition is for children to have a “healthy nutrition”, and possibly being able to define more clearly about what that means for children across the world.</p>
