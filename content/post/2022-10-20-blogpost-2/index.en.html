<p>~Data Loading and Cleaning</p>
<p>In order to load the dataset, we had to use the readxl::readxlsx function. However, once we imported the data, we realized that the format the dataset was in did not import properly. The column names did not appear and were instead relocated into the rows. In order to fix these issues, we had to go back to the original data set in excel and reformat the data to ensure that each column and its respective data matched up properly. Once that issue was fixed, the dataset was imported with no errors. There is still some cleaning left to do, like removing certain NA values, but now that the data is in R we will be able to start that process.</p>
<p>To tidy dataset, we have considered a few options. The first instinct was to ignore the countries such as Anguilla, British Virgin Islands that have “data unavailable” for each column, but keeping other countries that are missing just a few variables such as Andorra, Bahrain. This is because if delete all those parts, they may impact the accuracy of the analysis and lead us to neglect the crucial outliers in the dataset. But for the whole empty row, it may benefit our analysis since those references have no value. However, these missing values could still be a part of the story, especially in terms of equity and building a full global perspective.</p>
<p>Also, we can use filter to divide the data into different levels. According to the classification, we can clearly see the gap between different countries. We can also put the classification into different world regions to see the gap between different regions.</p>
<p>We plan to be able to run a more thorough explanatory data analysis once we’ve figure out the best route to take to tidy the dataset.</p>
