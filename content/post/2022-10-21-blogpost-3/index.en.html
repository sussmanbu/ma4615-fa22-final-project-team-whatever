Data Equity 

  The principles of equitable data are very relevant to our data, which is UNICEF's data on Nutrition in Newborns, infants, and young children. UNICEF is dedicated to equitable data practices in order to ensure that children and their rights are being benefited at every discovery. With this data set we will be analyzing the conditions of nutrition in each country (such as vegetable/fruit consuption and minimum meal frequency), in order to better understand the state of nutrition in young children across the world. 
  
  
  Working with data about child rights can run the risk of being harmful, especially in this particular data set that lists country level data from around the world. The misinterpretation of the data could lead to being insensitive of the country’s current state. Knowledge of other factors or variables in the country (i.e. socioeconomic status, poverty, etc.) may help better explain the sensitive topic of infant and young children malnutrition. That being said, UNICEF’s data collectors work with communities to understand any cultural elements, and to also encourage countries in using data to contribute to the global database. 
Since our data sets includes all countries, we will be certain that we are not only targeting a few communities, but rather provide justice in our communications of our results to ensure readers and analysts understand our findings on an world-based view. 

  The data itself is pretty transparent when it comes to why data is unavailable or has a certain mark, definitions of the indicators, and its main data sources. We hope to assume that since UNICEF is a nonprofit organization, and their intentions with this data is to use it to spread awareness and develop ways to help children suffering from malnutrition on a global scale. All their data is available to the public in hopes of achieving these goals. Our goal for the project will be to join it with other data that may help explain any conditions that bring about the results we see in this data set. Maybe this can help us to understand any discrepancies in the data and give us insight into how the data can be more efficient and inclusive.
