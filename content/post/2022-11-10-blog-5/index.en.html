<p>=======
When deciding what data sets to add, we came across a Mortality Under 5 set that houses country-wide mortality rates for children under the age of 5. We have been having trouble finding a clear question to focus on with the Nutrition data set, so we decided to switch our perspective to investigate Nutrition and Low Birth weight as an influential factor of Mortality Rates.</p>
<p>Here are a few steps we need to take to use this Mortality data set:
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
1. May narrow down years to 2013- 2018 to match the Nutrition data set
2. Values given as rates per thousand, so we would transform it to percentages</p>
<p>Why do some countries have higher mortality rates than others? (Nutrition + GDP, Sanitation, new factors)

# 1. May narrow down years to 2013- 2018 to match the Nutrition data set - have a more recent outlook
# 2. Values given as rates per thousand, so we would transform it to percentages</p>
<p>We have already done most of this cleaning in the load and clean data script.</p>
<p>Challenges: When attempting the combination, we realized that the country columns do not necessarily match. This could be confusing and give us misleading results - so we have to find which countries do not match and try to fix it.</p>
<p>Question: What are some influential factors that cause countries have higher mortality rates than others? (possible factors: Nutrition, GDP, Sanitation)
