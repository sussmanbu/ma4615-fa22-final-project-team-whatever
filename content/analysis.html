<p>We describe here our detailed data analysis. Most of our data for analysis is accredited to UNICEF database.</p>
<p>On this page we will introduce you to our analysis, provide some initial questions about the data, and present the figures we produced while exploring the different relationships within the data.</p>
<p>Please use the links throughout the page to direct you to more information related to our data and analyzation process.</p>
<div id="our-motivation-for-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Our Motivation for Analysis</h2>
<p>Our data is mainly driven by investigating the state of the world’s children under the age of 5. Through our analysis, we will have a better idea of how influential our chosen variables are to the survival and health of children around the world.</p>
<p>Some variables we are most interested in include:</p>
<pre><code>* Nutrition
* Low birth weight 
* Minimum diet diversity(6-23months)
* Minimum meal frequency(6-23months)
* Zero vegetable or fruit consumption (6-23months)
+ Mortality Rate 
        * Includes years 1950 - 2020
+ Income per capita</code></pre>
<p>With these variables, we hope to learn more about the connection between economics, nutrition, and child mortality across regions. We can also try to get some idea as to what triggers a higher child mortality rate in particular nations with respect to the variables above. Then, we could compare the differences with countries with a lower rate. As a result, it might be possible to pinpoint improvements that could be made to the children’s living circumstances as well as the areas where making changes would have the greatest potential to save young lives.</p>

<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the differences in low birthweight between each world region?</li>
<li>What is the relationship over time between mortality rates for children under the age of 5?</li>
<li>Does income have a significant contribution to the characteristics of a country with lower mortality rates?</li>
<li>What are some relationships between nutrition variables, such as exclusive breast feeding rate and the average income per capita per region?</li>
<li>As the income increases, does diet diversity also increase for the children’s nutrition?</li>
</ol>

<div id="figure-one-low-birthweight-in-each-region" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure one: Low Birthweight in each Region</h2>
<p>Here, we wanted to give a visual to represent the percentage variability in low birthweight among these regions. Based on the bar chart, South Asia has a visible larger percentage of children that fall in this category. Moving forward, we will keep an eye on South Asia and the relationships that may have impacted this one.</p>

<div id="figure-two-mortality-rates-and-income-per-capita" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure Two: Mortality Rates and Income per Capita</h2>
<p>This figure shows that over time, mortality rates have decreased. We have grouped the countries into their respective continent, so the relationships between the continents can be viewed easily through the time span here.</p>

<div id="figure-three-relationship-between-income-and-infants-that-are-exclusively-breastfed" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure Three: Relationship between Income and Infant’s that are exclusively breastfed</h2>
<p>This is our first attempt at exploring a variable from the nutrition data set with income per capita. Here we are able to see that as income increases, exclusive breast feeding for children’s nutrition decreases. Exclusive breast feeding, according to this data, is described as the</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Percentage of infants 0-5 months of age who were fed exclusively with breastmilk during the previous day.</code></pre>
<p>This relationship with income could signify that higher income regions are more likely to have alternatives to breastfeeding for infants. Of course this is just a hypothesis, but a question to keep in mind.</p>

<div id="figure-four-relationship-between-income-per-capita-and-child-diet-diversity" class="section level2">
<h2>Figure Four: Relationship between Income per capita and Child Diet Diversity</h2>
<p>Below is a figure that suggets that the diet diversity variable steadily increases as the average income per capita increases.
Minimum diet diversity, according to the data, is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;Percentage of children who received foods from at least 5 out of 8 defined food groups during the previous day. </code></pre>
<p>With this in mind, a possible synthesis is that higher averages of income provide more opportunities to fulfill the diet for all 8 defined food groups.</p>

<h2>Figure Five: World Map: Under 5 Mortality Rates across countries</h2>
<p>Below, we use the world map to give a clear representation of the how mortality rates are distributed across the world. The darker colored blue countries show a much higher rate than those with the very light color. We are also able to see the change in color across each continent, or region, which is harder to see in other figures, which is way this is a good graphical representation of our main variable.</p>

<h2>Figure Six</h2>
<p>Here is a similair representation of the same data as above, however we are able to more clearly decipher the major trend in mortality rates across world region.</p>

<h2>Figure Seven: correlation between under 5 mortality rates and income per capita</h2>
<p>This figure explores the relationship between income and mortality. As forecasted, we see that as the income increases, the mortality rates show a pattern of decline, with a few outliers.</p>

<div id="figures-eight-and-nine-vaccines-and-mortality-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Figures Eight and Nine: Vaccines and Mortality Rates</h2>
<p>Both of these figures use are vaccine variables to display their relationship with mortality rates as well. The vaccine variable represent the rate that a 1 year old child has at least one vaccine for a particular disease (please refer back to the variable explanation page for more information). We see a steady decline in overall mortality rates as the vaccination rate increases. The second figure presents this relationship across the years of 1980 - 2019, with points colored by the continent.</p>
