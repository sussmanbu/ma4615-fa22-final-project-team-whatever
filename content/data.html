<p>As the world continues to face adversities that threaten our future, we hope that our project can provide some insight for an important factor - the health and survival of future generations around the world. Our project takes a global perspective, which is reflected in the data we discovered. Below we will discuss the process of obtaining and cleaning, as well as the contents, of the data. Inspired by UNICEF’s mission for data collection, we have created a project that holds an influential and timeless analysis of the progress of children mortality rates around the globe.</p>

<h2>Part 1: The Original Dataset</h2>
<p>Our original data set is a Nutrition data report from UNICEF, which can be found here: <a href="https://datascienceinrfa2022.slack.com/files/U041CK3KQ04/F046DRAP9QD/table-7-and-8-nutrition-en.xlsx?origin_team=T03ULS93NUE&amp;origin_channel=C045P4CGA04" class="uri">https://datascienceinrfa2022.slack.com/files/U041CK3KQ04/F046DRAP9QD/table-7-and-8-nutrition-en.xlsx?origin_team=T03ULS93NUE&amp;origin_channel=C045P4CGA04</a></p>

<h3>About the source - UNICEF:</h3>
<p>The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is an organization that is dedicated to child development around the world. Their research provides data that gives an equitable view of the state of many factors such as poverty, education, violence, and health. Their efforts have led them to become the number one source of data in these matters, and continue to provide their data with easy access in hopes to educate the public about why they do the work that they do.</p>
<p>As this with our source, our plan in this project is to develop an analysis of the data into a comprehensible report that helps people get a more connected perception of some influence of certain factors, such as nutrition and GDP on the mortality rates of children under the age of 5. Below, we continue to explain the process of cleaning and combining these data sets.</p>

<h3>Nutrition Data set</h3>
<p>This is the first data set we chose to tackle. The variables of the data include low birthweight, which is mainly sourced from modelled estimates from World Health Organization alongside UNICEF, which is shown as the percentage of infants weighing less than 2,500 grams at birth. Other variables that we may include from this data, such as minimum meal frequency and zero vegetable or fruit consumptions are the percentage of children who were able to have solid/soft foods for a minimum time and the percentage of children or ate zero vegetables or fruits, respectively. The ages of the children for these two variables range from 6-23 months.</p>
<p>In this data table, Low birth weight percentages are from 2015, and the infant and children feeding variables range from the years 2013 - 2018. At first we thought would be helpful in being able to focus on a pretty recent year range, however we discuss the limitations to this below on the page.</p>
<p>All of this information is according to the data set itself, which explicitly lists the sources and variable meanings.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Cleaning the Dataest</h2>
<p>In order to clean our Nutrition Data set we first had to deal with the issue of loading our data set into our R environment. The formatting of our original data set was extremely awkward and difficult to use. The column names did not appear and were instead relocated into the rows. In order to fix these issues, we had to go back to the original data set in excel and reformat the data to ensure that each column and its respective data matched up properly. From there we re-named each column using the names() function, rounded all values to 2 decimal places and replaced empty values with NA using the as.numeric() function and the round function, completing the cleaning part of our Nutrition Dataset.</p>
